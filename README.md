## The project

The goal of the project is to create a static website using HTML/CSS and a bit of JS for the mobile menu.


###### My Solution + Process
I wanted to create a simple and elegant webpage where I can showcase the beauty of these instruments we use everyday: stationery. 
It can be pens, paperclips, notebooks. In this website, I want to emphasize how they make a difference in our everyday lives.
The website is relaxing and clean to really highlight these amazing instruments.

###### Tools + Techniques

```
* HTML/CSS
* Vanilla JS (a bit for the mobile menu)
* Flex boxes
* Bootstrap
* CSS Transitions
```
### In conclusion

I enjoyed creating this website with just HTML and CSS. 
It really challenged me to make it beautiful, immersive, and friendly using limited resources.

I would definitely come back and edit my code to SASS it up and add actual content instead of lorem ipsum!
