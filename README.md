# Welcome!


Hello awesome human being(or..alien?) and thank you for taking the time to view my repos!
As you can see, most of my projects are coming from my classes here at SAIT.
Thatâ€™s because I am still a student and I am learning lots of things! I am loving this course so far and there are so many things I want to learn. I will be coming back to clean up my code after this program and see what else I can do to make my projects better.


## The project

The goal of the project is to create a static website using HTML/CSS and a bit of JS for the mobile menu.


###### My Solution + Process
I wanted to create a simple and elegant webpage where I can showcase the beauty of these instruments we use everyday: stationery. 
It can be pens, paperclips, notebooks. In this website, I want to emphasize how they make a difference in our everyday lives.
The website is relaxing and clean to really highlight these amazing instruments.

###### Tools + Techniques

```
* HTML/CSS
* Vanilla JS (a bit for the mobile menu)
* Flex boxes
* Bootstrap
* CSS Transitions
```
### In conclusion

I enjoyed creating this website with just HTML and CSS. 
It really challenged me to make it beautiful, immersive, and friendly using limited resources.

I would definitely come back and edit my code to SASS it up and add actual content instead of lorem ipsum!
